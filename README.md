<body> I am new to coding (I know basic Javascript and basic Html),<br> Im trying to make something to prank my cousin and I need to know if my program will work.
<br> Im hoping my program will open a window at the windows 10 start up that will spam "Haha sucka" <br>and it wont be closeable for a while. Did I do this right? <br>
I would also like to know of some good websites to make and test programs if anyone has reccomendations?<br>
